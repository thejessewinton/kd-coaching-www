I wouldn’t have been able to do it without the studio helping to guide me the whole way. Thanks to the studio, I've taken master classes from industry professionals that have really pushed me to do my best. KD coaching has really become my second home and has helped me to make great connections with my fellow actors that will help me to be more successful down the road.",

I was able to really dissect and perfect my skills here and had several opportunities available to me.  Kelly truly cares about creating an inclusive environment in which students feel safe to fail, create, and grow. I’m so grateful for the time I spent here.",

My experience there has helped me grow, both in acting and in life. Kelly is an amazing teacher, who connects with her students and is able to give guidance. She doesn’t only focus on training and technique, but also mental health and how her student is really feeling. I have always felt very comfortable and safe with Kelly, and I have always had great discussions with her.",
