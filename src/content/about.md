Kelly Ann Dunn is the proud owner of KD Coaching, a branch of her main business, KD Studios. She grew up in the Sacramento area, performing at theatres locally and singing professionally in Los Angeles aboard ships and at hotels. She studied musical theatre at Point Park University and eventually transferred to William Jessup University where she earned her B.A degree in Creative Arts-Theatre. At Jessup, she learned about the importance of storytelling and making an impact through acting which inspired her to go live out her dreams for a time in NYC.

After living in NYC, she moved back to CA to open the studio to pursue her passions of performing, teaching, and mentoring student’s through life. She can be seen in films on NETFLIX and AMAZON PRIME as well as around the country performing at regional theatres. Some of her favorite credits include ROSAMUND in THE ROBBER BRIDEGROOM, GLORIA in Boeing Boeing, June in MUSICALS OF MUSICALS, and Jan in GREASE. She was also seen in HBO’S SHARP OBJECTS as a featured actor (“Ashley’s Girl”) and has appeared in some McDonalds, Intel, and Burger King commercials and ads as well as claiming her fame in Japan by appearing on their popular TV show WORLD’S ASTONISHING NEWS. She can also be seen behind the scenes producing, casting, and directing for local theatres and projects in Sacramento and the east coast. She hopes to instill confidence into all of her students and to help them grow into people who believe in themselves, love others, and fiercely pursue their dreams.
